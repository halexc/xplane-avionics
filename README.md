# xplane-avionics
This is a repository containing the project code for my modern avionics to use on custom aircraft in x-Plane 11. The code uses various elements which can be put together to fit the needs of different avionics setups. Currently, it is being tested in a custom A220/CSeries aircraft.

# Use
In short, this porject is supposed to be used as a library to ease the implementation of complex avionics user interfaces. The various DisplayElements can be seen as building blocks to create interactive displays in your custom X-Plane 11 aircraft.

To get a better idea of how to use this, check out the main.cpp file or the [wiki](https://github.com/halexc/xplane-avionics/wiki/Home). Be sure to include all the relevant files. Note that the resource files referenced in 'main.cpp' are not included in this repository, so you need to either manually put them together, or download the compiled project from my [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OuqBDfoqqX4u9EepGHsWGPgsK04wjkCJ/view).
